<h1>bin2dec</h1>
bin2dec is Binary to Decimal Convertor. I built this CLI app to solve and handle some problems in exceptional situations about developing Bash/Batch scripts when they need to know binary format.<br><br>
Below there are two example of running code in action:<br><br>

Run with command line argument:<br>

You can see the app with command line argument is very silent and the only output is specified result without color. It's useful when you want to use the output as an input for another app or use it in a variable or in conditions and expression. Below you can see this kind of usage:<br>
